I'm not competing in the advent of code in the traditional way. I'm not looking for the fastest solution to obtain the highest amount of points. I do however, like to solve the puzzles and do so while trying to write the code as cleanly as possible with all the applicable best practices, including documentation unit testing and some for of actual deployment. Last year my goal was to write some of the Advent of Code challenges following the principles of Test Driven Development(TDD). This year, I am not sticking to that as strictly and am more focussed on having some form of testing, and actually completing all 30 challenges (allthough I will aim to do in 60 days not 30 as my schedule won't allow for more). Feel free to open up an issue if you have any suggestions or feedback, I'm always looking to learn from my peers.
